This file define the format in packet filter file.

1. Synopsis

The file is a line-based file, that is, one condition, one including file or one comment per line.
A condition is a filter, we use the condition to filter the packet,
all condition in the file is `LOGICAL AND`.

There are 8 types of object in the file. Each file occupy one line.

	1. Comment (#)
	2. File (@include)
	3. Protocol ($)
	4. Attribute (%)
	5. Description (&)
	6. Value
	7. Condition
	8. Blank line

2. Define Some Concept

Before we introduce those objects, we first define some concept.

2.1 In-Line-Blank
	In-Line-Bank consists of blanks that can not indicate one line, such space, Tab.

3. Define Object

3.1. Comment (#)

	Comment is line-based comment. It begin with `#`, and last to the end of line. In-Line-Blank can leading or following comments. But we do not support conditions leading comments. Below are some examples, | is the left boundery of the file, \n is the new line character.

	Comment					Correct ?
	|# this is coment\n			Y
	|   # this is comment\n			Y
	|some-none-blank # this is comment\n	N

3.2. File (@)

	File indicate include another file, File is leading with @. A file included, is like replacing the line with the whole included file. The format is:

	@<path-to-file>

Examples:

	File					Correct ?
	|@/tmp/file1\n				Y
	|     @/tmp/file2     \n		Y
	|@  /tmp/file3\n			N, space is not allow after @

3.3. Protocol

	Protocol indicate a protocol name, it is a condition. It begin with $. When an Protocol condition occurs, all attributes defined below are those in the protocol, until another Protocol condition occurs. Protocol names are defined in fbc_common.h Format is:

	$<Ptotocol_name>

Examples:

	Protocol				Correct ?
	|$TCP\n					Y
	|   $ETHER	\n			Y
	|$  ETHER	\n			N, in-line-blank is not allow after $

3.4. Attribute (%)

	Attribute is a field defined in a protocol. The protocol is the nearest above protocol. The Attribute condition format is:

	%Attribute=<Value>

All Attribute has is own type, please reference to the protocol attribute file.

Examples:

	Attribute				Correct ?
	|%src=192.168.1.1\n			Y
	|  %src=192.168.1.1  \n			Y
	|%  src=192.168.1.1\n			N
	|%src = 192.168.1.1\n			N

3.5. Description (&)

	Description is used to description attribute. Some attribute prefer description than value, such as, checksum, it prefer good or bad, rather than checksum is 0x1234. Format is:

	&Description

Examples:

	Description				Correct ?
	|%checksum=&good\n			Y
	|%checksum=& good\n			N

3.6. Value
